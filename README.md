# It's Always Sunny in Clickadelphia! :sunny:

A fun little click-based game using React.

## How to play :bulb:

The game is so simple even Charlie could understand it. Simply click the pictures, but don't hit the same one twice!

The max score is 12 points but the pictures will shuffle after each click, so it may take you a few tries.


### Enjoy the game :v:
